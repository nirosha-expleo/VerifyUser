# 🎯 Simple Steps - No Confusion!

## What You Need to Do (3 Steps):

### ✅ Step 1: Run the Script
```bash
./DEPLOY_MANUAL.sh
```
**This creates the branch automatically!** You don't need to do anything else here.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Go to GitHub Website

1. Open: https://github.com/nirosha-expleo/VerifyUser
2. Click **"Settings"** (top menu)
3. Click **"Pages"** (left sidebar)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Select the Branch

In the Pages settings, you'll see:

```
Source: [Dropdown - select "Deploy from a branch"]
Branch: [Dropdown - select "gh-pages"]
Folder: [Dropdown - select "/ (root)"]
```

Then click **"Save"**

---

## That's It! 🎉

- **You DON'T create the branch** - the script does it
- **You just tell GitHub** which branch to use for your website
- **Wait 2-3 minutes** and your app will be live!

---

## Your App URL:
```
https://nirosha-expleo.github.io/VerifyUser/
```

---

**Think of it like this:**
- Script = Creates the files and branch
- GitHub Pages Settings = Tells GitHub "use this branch for my website"

You're just doing step 2 (telling GitHub which branch to use)!
